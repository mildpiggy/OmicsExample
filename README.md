This repository contains some proteomics data from:

A. The results from a multi-omics study of silicosis mouse model (DOI: [10.1038/s41392-022-00959-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00959-3)). The proteomics data was analysis by MaxQuant, and the gene counts table was generated by HISAT2 and GenomicsAlignments from RNA-seq.

B. A benchmark proteomics data by spiking Yeast and E.coli proteome into Hela background. The proteomics data is measured by an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid, in either Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) or Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mode. The DDA data was analysed by MaxQuant or FragPipe, and the DIA data was analysed by Spectronaut or DIA-NN respectively without library. The reference proteome is from Uniprot and contains reviewed sequences of Homo sapiens, S.cerevisiae and Escherichia coli (strain K12).

All quantitative tables were compressed into .gz files.
